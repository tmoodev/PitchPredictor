# Executive Summary

The **Pitch Prediction Project** aims to leverage historical baseball pitch-level data and advanced machine learning techniques to **predict the next pitch** in real-time after a user enters the current game situation. By combining data ingestion, cleaning, exploration, and modeling, the project provides an end-to-end pipeline for accurate and scalable pitch-type prediction.

## Primary Goal
**Predict the next pitch** (e.g., fastball, curveball, changeup) after entering the current game context (such as count, inning, previous pitch type, etc.).

---

## Key Steps

1. **Data Ingestion & Storage**  
   - **PyBaseball Integration:** Fetch historical pitch-level data (speed, location, pitcher ID, etc.) using PyBaseball.  
   - **Data Storage:** Store the raw data in Parquet or CSV formats for efficient processing and scalability.

2. **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
   - **Spark Environment Setup:** Use Apache Spark for large-scale data processing.  
   - **Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Handle missing values, remove outliers, and create game context features (balls, strikes, inning). Generate lag features (e.g., previous pitch type) to capture sequential aspects.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Zeppelin Integration:** Perform interactive data exploration in Apache Zeppelin notebooks connected to Spark.  
   - **Visualizations:** Analyze pitch distribution, correlations between pitch characteristics, and sequential patterns within at-bats.

4. **Model Building**  
   - **Baseline Models:** Start with straightforward classifiers (logistic regression, random forest) using Spark MLlib.  
   - **Advanced Sequential Models:** For capturing pitch sequences, explore LSTM or RNN approaches, which may involve TensorFlow or PyTorch alongside Spark.

5. **Evaluation & Iteration**  
   - **Metrics:** Track accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.  
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use grid search and cross-validation in Spark to refine the model.

6. **Deployment & Real-Time Prediction**  
   - **Containerization with Docker:** Ensure consistency across environments and facilitate scalable deployment.  
   - **Streaming Data (Optional):** Integrate Apache Kafka with Spark Structured Streaming to handle live pitch data and deliver real-time predictions.

7. **Documentation & Presentation**  
   - **Project Write-Up:** Provide clear and detailed documentation, including a portfolio or blog series outlining the end-to-end process.  
   - **Repository & Demo:** Maintain a well-structured GitHub repository, complete with README files, sample notebooks, and a video walkthrough demonstrating the final solution.

## Outcome
This comprehensive pipeline—from data ingestion to model deployment—provides a robust framework for **predicting the next pitch** in a live or historical baseball context. By integrating Spark for large-scale processing, leveraging advanced modeling techniques for sequential data, and implementing real-time streaming capabilities, the project lays the groundwork for an **accurate, scalable, and actionable** pitch prediction system.
